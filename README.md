OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT PROJECT :DISTRIBUTED DATA PROCESSING

Objective
To use Apache Spark for analyzing a large dataset, implementing operations like filtering, grouping, and aggregations, and showcasing the results through a Spark job script.

Key Components
PySpark Setup: Installing and configuring PySpark.

Data Loading: Loading the dataset into a Spark DataFrame.

Data Filtering: Filtering rows based on specific criteria.

Grouping and Aggregations: Grouping the data by specific columns and calculating aggregations.

Saving Results: Saving the results to a new file.

Steps to Accomplish the Project
Set up PySpark Environment:

Install PySpark using pip: pip install pyspark

Configure your Spark session.

Load the Dataset:

Use PySpark's DataFrame API to load the dataset from a CSV file or any other supported source.

Explore the Dataset:

Display the initial DataFrame to understand the data structure and identify relevant columns.

Filter Data:

Filter rows based on specific criteria (e.g., Age > 25).

Group and Aggregate Data:

Group the data by specific columns (e.g., Occupation) and calculate aggregations (e.g., average Age and count of rows).

Save the Results:

Save the grouped and aggregated data to a new CSV file.

Document the Process:

Create a Spark job script to document and showcase the data analysis process, including code comments and explanations.

Expected Outcomes
Filtered and Aggregated Data: A dataset that has been filtered, grouped, and aggregated based on specific criteria.

Spark Job Script: A well-documented Spark job script showcasing the data processing and analysis steps.

Analysis Results: Enhanced data insights, ready for further analysis or reporting.
